# Custom-Encryption-Algorithm
A custom encryption program written in C that uses a simple S-box networks and XOR operations.
It runs on ECB mode using 32 bit blocks.

This program will encrypt files (any format) using a 32 bit key. It will also attempt to brute force the key towards the end of its execution.

NOTE: Created only for educational purposes. DO NOT USE FOR ACUTAL ENCRYPTION.
